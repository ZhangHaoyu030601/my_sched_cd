Implementation of a real time scheduler that allows you to run a set of periodic tasks according to a clock driven approach, using a static scheduling algorithm that provides the system with a feasible schedule.

**busy_wait** is a simulation of the running of a task.

**tasks** is the static timetable (original form in tt_table.h). Also see **figure.png**.
